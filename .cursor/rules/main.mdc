# AI Agent Development Guidelines

## Development Philosophy
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability
- Follow clean code principles consistently
- Ensure comprehensive quality checks before completion
- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence

## Documentation Philosophy
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Work Process Guidelines
- Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes
- Preserve existing code and functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures
- Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file
- Provide real file links, not x.md

## Communication Guidelines
- Never use apologies
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation
- Don't summarize changes made
- Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context
- Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed
- Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested
