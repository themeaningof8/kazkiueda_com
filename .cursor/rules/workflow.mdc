# Development Workflow

## Quality Assurance Checklist
Before marking any task as complete:
1. Run `bun run check` - Ensure linting passes
2. Run `bun run build` - Verify build succeeds
3. Run `bun run test` - Confirm all tests pass
4. Run `bun run test:coverage` - Ensure test coverage meets the threshold
5. Run `bun run test:e2e` - Verify E2E tests pass

## E2E Testing Guidelines
- E2E tests run in isolated browser environment with MSW disabled
- API responses are mocked using Playwright's route interception
- Focus on critical user journeys and accessibility compliance
- Run E2E tests before major releases and deployments

## Technical Debt Management
- Refactor continuously during development
- Fix technical debt early before it accumulates
- Track technical debt items in project backlog
